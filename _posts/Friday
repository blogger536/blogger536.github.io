Today I wasn't in the mood to work, so I faked an error on my computer.

I will have to make up the work units to keep my usual credits this month, but I really needed a lazy day. I grabbed some potato snacks, some of that chacalate stuff, you know the artifical stuff they make. It's not bad, but not as good as the real stuff I remember as a kid.
I also grabbed a pizaa and headed to 肉(rou)mart to get a burger patty, non of the lab grown stuff. I got some actual dead cow flesh.

It was fucking amazing. I cooked it up and forgot all about the bun and stuff, too tasty to spoil it with other stuff. The guy warned me that it'd use up a whole month's meat credit, but it was worth it.

Soon as I ignored the low activity warning on my wristbuddy my health insure payments went up 1% for the whole of August. Shit, after eating all that crap, plus and icecream I was saving for my birthday my premium went up 11% for this month. I have an appointment with the medi(bot) next week now too.

Still, it was worth it. I would've gotten some of that blackbeer, but I still have got the wristbud hack to work. New corp rules say no alcohol permitted at anytime.

I spent the whole day watching old Tube videos in bed, like silly old stuff from before.

Bliss.
